# perceptron
Basic perceptron algorithm. Uses a neural network to estimate the output of a binary array

Asks the user to input ten binary values (0 or 1) and predicts the output value based on the training cases.

Eleven training cases are used in the code, and the corresponding output values are simply the fourth value in the test case.
For example, the case [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0] has an output of 0 since the fourth value is 0.
